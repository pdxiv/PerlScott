# PerlScott
## Introduction
Fully functioning (hopefully) Scott Adams adventure game interpreter, written in Perl.
## Development background of the interpreter
This was painstakingly converted to Perl from the version 4.6 TRS-80 Level II Basic source code. The code was published in the December 1980 issue of Byte Magazine (page 192). Since this version didn't support many of the features in latest versions of the engine (8.3?), these were added as well.

Even though GOTOs are painful to convert to structured programming, the original code was well-written enough to make it possible!
